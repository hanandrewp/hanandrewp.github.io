		<h2>NSA contractors receive over $250 million through NIH in 2012</h2>
		<h3>SAIC Inc., Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc., receive contracts</h3>
		<p1>Security contractors involved with NSA surveillance programs have also received as much as $250 million through NIH grants in 2012. SAIC, Inc. received $269 million through it's wholly owned subsidiary SAIC-Frederick, Inc., which has been contracted to run the National Cancer Institute's Frederick Research Center since 2008. Booz Allen & Hamilton, Inc. received $29 million for work done on the National Children's Survey.</p1>
		<br><br>
		<p2>Next steps: Call National Cancer Institute to determine the nature of the contract. Get comment from SAIC and Booz Allen Hamilton.</p2>

		<h2>NIH drastically reduces the number of training grants for young scientists in 2013</h2>
		<h3>Half as many grants given out to fund Ph.D, MD-Ph.D., nursing and pharmacy programs and post-doctoral fellowships. </h3>
		<p1>Faced with sequestration cuts, the NIH has halved the number of new grants given to train young scientists and medical professionals so far in 2013, when compared to the same time period in 2012. Through the month of June, the NIH has issued only 806 new Individual Training grants in the calendar year 2013, compared with 1501 during the same period in 2012.</p1>
		<br><br>
		<p2>Next Steps: talk to Primary Investigators at labs and get quotes on if they have taken fewer graduate students. Talk to new graduate students and post-docs to see if there is anxiety about funding their graduate studies. Talk to NIH people in charge of these types of grants.</p2>

		<h2>Johns Hopkins University retains top spot as NIH's most awarded institution</h2>
		<h3>Received over $700 million in NIH grants.</h3>
		<p1>There are few certainties in life. That Johns Hopkins University will receive more money in NIH grants than any other institution seems to be among them. Continuing a streak that has gone on more than a decade, the Baltimore, Md. university brought in over $700 million, over $150 million more than the runner-up, the University of California at San Francisco.</p1>

		<h2>Meet the NIH's most awarded scientist</h2>
		<h3>Douglas Lowy: from Gardasil to NIH's top grantee.</h3>
		<p1>Despite laying the scientific foundation for the Human Papilloma Virus(HPV) vaccine Gardasil and running a major research lab at the National Cancer Institute, Douglas Lowy has managed to keep a low profile. That may no longer be the case. In 2012, the NIH awarded Lowy more grant money than any other scientist, giving his lab $57 million.</p1>
		<br><br>
		<p2>Next steps: Call Lowy for interview. Speak with makers of Gardisil for comment on his contributions.</p2>

		<h2>NIH and J. Craig Venter have buried the hatchet over the Human Genome Project</h2>
		<h3>J. Craig Venter Institute receives $21 million in NIH grants in 2012.</h3>
		<p1>If money is any indication, the NIH has forgiven Craig Venter for breaking from the pack a decade ago to try and take the prize of sequencing the human genome by himself. The J. Craig Venter Institute received $21 million through NIH awards in 2012, mostly for genome sequencing projects. That's a lot more than the institute received when it was started in 2005; the NIH "only" awarded it $8 million.</p1>
		<br><br>
		<p2>Next Steps: find out where the money is coming from. Talk to Francis Collins, head of NIH and chief rival of Venter during the Human Genome Project. Talk to Venter.</p2>
